====================================
1. Building
====================================

Using GNU make, type:
	make
        sudo make install

This will build the client, server, and backups.  The install step
simply installs the RAMCloud client library and headers in /usr/local.

====================================
2. Running
====================================

To run you must have 3 things.  A running server, a running backup,
and some kind of client.

2.1 Starting a server

$ ./obj.master/server/server

2.2 Starting a backup

$ ./obj.master/backup/backup

2.3 Using the libramcloud.so library

Write a client application using the interface described in
/usr/local/include/ramcloud/client.h.  Compile with:

$ gcc -lramcloud -I/usr/local/include/ramcloud -o test-client test-client.c

2.2 Using the Python bindings:

$ PYTHONPATH=bindings/python python
>>> import ramcloud
>>> c.connect()
>>> c.write(0, 0, 'Hello from Python!')

====================================
3. Testing
